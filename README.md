### Purpose

This is a Group Activity consisting of at least 2 and up to 5 members each.
The Group is tasked with creating an Exam Application like Blackboard’s Quiz
or Exam feature.

To set expectations, Users of your Exam Application should be directed to the
Exam UI and begin taking the exam immediately. Each question should appear on
its own in a paginated manner, and Users should be able to switch to the next
question and go back at any time. The correct answer should not be visible to the
User until they submit the Exam. Afterwards, their total score should be made visible
as a separate screen.

The exam questions that you will add on your application is provided
alongside this Laboratory Exercise document as a JSON file. It is up to the team how
they will integrate this file to their application as long as it works. The questions will
be a mix of Multiple Choice, True or False, and Identification (Fill-in-the-blanks)
questions.
